# Crude-Oil-Quality-Analysis-and-Well-Integrity-Monitoring-System
This project is a Python-based tool designed to analyze crude oil quality parameters (e.g., API gravity, viscosity, sulfur content) and simulate well integrity monitoring using sensor data. The tool processes real-time or historical data, generates reports, and visualizes trends to help oilfield technicians and engineers make informed decisions.
